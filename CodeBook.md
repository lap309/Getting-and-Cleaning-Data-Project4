CODEBOOK

The dataset is a human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects. The experiment shows volunteers performing various activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. A smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) was used to capture data from the differnt physical actions of each volunteer.

Each record in the dataset provides:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

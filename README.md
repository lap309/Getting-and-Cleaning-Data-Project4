# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project4
This Project combines data from a test and a training data set to be cleaned and reformatted


The process of this code involves:
Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


In this repository is a Tidy Data text file that has been cleaned and organized, a code book with the name of the variables, and the R code for reproducability.
